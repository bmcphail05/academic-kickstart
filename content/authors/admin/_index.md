I am a PhD student in sociology at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. My research interests include religion, family, health, religious ecology, and East Asia.

My dissertation examines how the religious ecology of local social environments in mainland China affect the health and mortality of the people in them.

I am currently a graduate student instructor in the [Purdue Sociology Department](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/sociology/), a research assistant at the [Center on Religion and the Global East](http://www.globaleast.org/), and an editorial assistant for the [*Review of Religion and Chinese Society*](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/22143955).
