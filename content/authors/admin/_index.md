Hi! I earned a PhD in sociology at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in West Lafayette, Indiana. My research interests include religion, family, health, and East Asia. My [dissertation]({{< ref "/project/religious-ecology-china/index.md" >}}) examines the ecological effects of religion on population health and mortality in mainland China. My research also investigates topics associated with religious diversity, religious ecology, and interreligious families.

Most recently, I was a graduate student instructor in the Purdue University [Department of Sociology](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/sociology/), a research assistant at the [Center on Religion and the Global East](http://www.globaleast.org/), and an editorial assistant for the [*Review of Religion and Chinese Society*](https://brill.com/view/journals/rrcs/rrcs-overview.xml).
