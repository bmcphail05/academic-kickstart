title: "Measuring Religious Change in the Global East"
summary: "This one-year project aims to develop survey questions to accurately measure religiosity in the Global East. It will take a bottom-up approach by adopting survey questions locally developed in various East Asian societies, construct a survey questionnaire of religion tailored to the Global East, translate it into multiple languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and English), and test the survey among international students at a university in the US."
